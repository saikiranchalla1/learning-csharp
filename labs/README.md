# How to submit the labs?

For this course, we'll use the C# Cookbook (a copy of the book is in the current folder). The book follows a pattern of problem-solution-description. You can download the book to your local and open it in any PDF Viewer (like Preview, Acrobat etc.).


To submit your labs:
1. Create a repository on Github. Add me (saikiranchalla1) as one of the contributors if you're creating a private repository.
2. In the repository, create a folder for each lab (lab1 = chapter 1, lab2 = chapter 2 of the book etc.).
3. Upload your solution files to the folder and send a link to the repository to your instructor.

Please create a separate solution for each lab/chapter.
