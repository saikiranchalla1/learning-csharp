# Project - 1
Create a Console Application in C# for student management. The app doesn't need a backend database at this time and should meet the following requirements.


1. Each student will have: name, DOB, id, grade, courses
2. There can be any number of students in a class.
3. There are only few pre-defined courses from which the students can choose.

You console application should accept the inpt from the user for all the student data and store it in memory (i.e. collections). 

It should also allow the following operations:

1. Retrieve student by ID
2. Modify a student's properties like DOB, grade, courses etc. but not ID.
3. Get the total number of students in a class.
4. Get the age of a student as of today.


Please note that the student's attributes will follow all the common name conventions and the name will have 3 parts: first name, optional middle name, and last name.
